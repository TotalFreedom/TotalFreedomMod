# ImmaFreedomMod #
<hr>

ImmaFreedomMod is a custom plugin made for ImmaFreedom, an associated server.


This plugin was originally made for the original Free OP server, TotalFreedom
This plugin was originally coded by StevenLawson (Madgeek1450), with Jerom van der Sar (Prozza) becoming heavily involved in its development some time later. It consists of over 85 custom coded commands and a large variety of distinguishable features not included in any other plugin. The plugin has since its beginning grown immensely. Together, with the main TotalFreedom server, TotalFreedomMod has a long-standing reputation of effectiveness whilst maintaining a clear feeling of openness towards the administrators and the players themselves.
The developers for the current plugin are aggelosQQ, AwesomePinch, LegendIsAwesomeness, Savnith, tylerhyperHD and OxLemonxO.
