# Blocked commands:
#
# How blocked commands work:
# All sections described below are delimited by colon characters.
# Make sure that you block a command by its main command name, not an alias
# as all aliases are blocked by default. Commands are case-insensitive.
#
# * The first section is a letter which indicates which rank may use this command
#   Valid ranks:
#   n - Nobody (Completely disabled)
#   c - Senior Admins (Console)
#   t - Telnet Admins (Console)
#   s - Super Admins (Any in-game admin)
#   o - Ops (Non-Ops won't be able to use it)
#
# * The second section is a letter which indicates what to do when a player executes that command.
#   Valid actions:
#   b - Block the command
#   a - Block the command and auto-eject that player (for ops and below)
#   u - Block the command and Return an "Unknown command" message (Used to hide commands)
#
# * The third section is the command to be blocked, prefixed with a slash
#
# * The fourth section is the message to send to the player when executing that command.
#   This should be ommited if unwanted. ChatColors are supported with the &-key. By default
#   -the starting ChatColor is set to gray. You can use the default 'That command is blocked.' message
#   by using a single underscore.
#
# Examples:
#   - 'n:b:/mail sendall:&4You can't send mails to everyone!'
#   - 's:a:/stop'
#   - 'n:b:/ban:_'
